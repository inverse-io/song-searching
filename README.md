# Song Searching using API
A node.js application that uses a public API and the express.js framework.

This uses a thick client, a client that expects the JSON data fro mthe server and generates the javascript itself. The server does not render the HTML.

## Prerequisites
Install the required packages and dependents listed in the .json files. To do so execute this command in terminal:
```
npm install
```

## Instructions
After ensuring that Nodejs and the packages are installed properly, run the server in terminal using:
```
node server.js
```
To run the client side to test, using a chrome based web browser use any of the links below:
```
http://localhost:3000/mytunes.html
http://localhost:3000/mytunes
http://localhost:3000/index.html
http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000
```
